During my learnings at Tachyon Systems, I gained comprehensive exposure to machine learning concepts and practices.
I developed expertise in data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation for reliable analysis.
Feature engineering techniques were applied to enhance model performance.
I built and evaluated both supervised models (regression, classification) and unsupervised models (clustering).

This learning journey enhanced my ability to design and deliver impactful ML solutions.
